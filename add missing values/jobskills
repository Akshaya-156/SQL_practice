PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
In the given input table, there are rows with missing JOB_ROLE values. Write a query to fill in those blank fields with appropriate values.
Assume row_id is always in sequence and job_role field is populated only for the first skill.
Provide two different solutions to the problem.
