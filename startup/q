You are given a table user events that tracks user activity with the following schema:

 

Table: events
+-------------+----------+
| COLUMN_NAME | DATA_TYPE|
+-------------+----------+
| user_id     | int      |    
| event_type  | varchar  |
| event_time  | timestamp|
+-------------+----------+
Task:

1. Identify user sessions. A session is defined as a sequence of activities by a user where the time difference between consecutive events is less than or equal to 30 minutes. If the time between two events exceeds 30 minutes, it's considered the start of a new session.

2. For each session, calculate the following metrics:

session_id : a unique identifier for each session.

session_start_time : the timestamp of the first event in the session.

session_end_time : the timestamp of the last event in the session.

session_duration : the difference between session_end_time and session_start_time.

event_count : the number of events in the session.
